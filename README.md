# Road Accident Dashboard-
A dynamic dashboard analyzing road accident data, highlighting casualty trends, vehicle types, road conditions, and locations to enhance safety and decision-making.
## Project Objective
Analyze road accident data using an Excel dashboard to identify trends, improve safety, and support data-driven decision-making.
## Process Used:  

1. Data Collection:* Gathered road accident data from reliable sources.  
2. Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies and prepared the data for analysis.  
3. Data Analysis: Analyzed casualty trends, road conditions, and vehicle types.  
4. Dashboard Creation: Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize key insights.  
5. Evaluation: Identified patterns and areas for safety improvements.

## Questions (KPIs)

Here are some Key Performance Indicator (KPI) questions for your **Road Accident Dashboard**:

1. What is the total number of road casualties, and how are they categorized (fatal, serious, slight)?  
2. Which vehicle type contributes the most to fatal casualties?  
3. What are the monthly trends in road casualties over the past two years?  
4. How do casualties differ by road type (single, dual, roundabout, etc.)?  
5. What is the distribution of casualties based on road surface conditions (dry, wet, snow/ice)?  
6. Are rural or urban areas experiencing higher casualty rates?  
7. What is the impact of lighting conditions (daylight vs. dark) on casualty rates?  
8. Which year had higher casualty counts, and what were the key differences?
